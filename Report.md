## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    Its so that communication between hosts on a network is feasible. Every device has its own respective IP address on the network.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    It is the domain name system and it allows for a more readable name that is thus translated to an IP address. The main benefit of using domain names is that is more readable than IP addresses

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IP addresses do not change, but dynamic IP addresses are assigned by the network when a device is connected and does change over time.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, reliable, has flow control, and does ordering and sequencing, but is considerably slower, while UDP is quite the opposite. UDP has no reliability guarentee but will communicate considerably faster.

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk framework is event based and utilizing the delay function can disrupt the timing and function of the program.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    That it halts the entire program to one certain instruction such as polling. We could spend our precious time doing another task than waiting for an event or input to occur.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    They allow for us to create programs that will continue operating but also be suspectible to being interrupted. Once interrupted, it will branch off and do its task, which it then returns back to the main. Interrupts allow for a constant flow of tasks being done and which are done through each individual priority level.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface is an empty shell that only contains the signatures of the methods, while the implementation is the actual body of the interface. You can't have one without the other!
